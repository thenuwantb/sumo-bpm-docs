The lecture series was designed to introduce the capabilities of the SUMO simulator. There, we discussed how to build a toy network to understand the basics of SUMO, work with real-world networks, incorporate actual traffic counts to represent traffic demand, and automate model building process using custom Python scripts available with SUMO.
